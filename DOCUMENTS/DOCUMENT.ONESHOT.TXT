Dear ****

Today is ****
This is my final letter to you, and i'm afraid I must make it brief.
I have left you my journal, written in a language that ****C**LD*U**ST****D.
Read it and you'll know everything.
I have also L***Y*U****SK, in case the toxic fumes ever spread.

Look for a large safe in the quarry to the ***T

Stay safe. Do not look for me.

The code to the safe is 060222
